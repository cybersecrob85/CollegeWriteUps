In the Project and Portfolio I: Information Technology course, students will apply their knowledge of operating systems, networking, and security practices to plan a technology solution based on a typical use case. Through this course, students will demonstrate and troubleshoot the design, installation, and configuration of a working project with servers and user endpoints. They will also create a written project plan documenting their work and detailing technology support. Upon completion of their projects, students will refine their technology solution and project plan and reflect on the process. Students will also gain practice with an industry certification test to prepare them for employment expectations.
